<br>
Here's a brief explanation of the Hangman game code:Here is the brief one what the Hangman game code in details:
Data Setup:
words_with_hints: A list of tuples which in every tuple there is a certain word and a hint associated with this word.
display_word Function:
Select a string containing underscores wherever the letters forming the word are not known, and g when the letters forming the word are known.
play_hangman Function:
Selects a Random Word and Hint: Choose one of the words from the list of words_with_hints and then choose hint from the pair which associated with this word.
Game Loop:
Teach a phrase, and or ask a question to which the initially guessed character should reply.
First of all it checks whether the letter hasn’t been guessed before and after that it checks whether the value of the given letter is in the word.
Converts the state of the word into all lower case characters as well as tracks the number of wrong guesses given out.
It is when the player presses the keyboard to input all respective alphabets in the right manner or when they ‘lose’ all the wrong icons of the game.
Victory or Loss: Based on the presented situation print an appropriate message to the player whether he has been winning or losing.
Game Start:
To begin a brand new game it has a function called by the name of play_hangman().
These are the special components of this game; the hint, the scores of correct and wrong answers, if in the middle of the game, the player either wins or utilizes all the opportunities of wrong turns, then the game stops automatically.
